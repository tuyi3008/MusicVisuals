# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Yi Tu

Student Number: C22365356

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

# Song Choice Reason

# Visualization Process

I aimed to represent the rhythm and emotion of the song through dynamic elements and rapidly changing colors in the visuals. I used fast animation effects and vibrant colors to express the energy and tension of the song. Through dynamic shapes and flickering effects, I sought to create a tense and exhilarating atmosphere, allowing the audience to feel the intense rhythm and dynamism of the song.

# Code Correspondence with Music

My code corresponds to the rhythm and emotion of the song through dynamic shapes, fast animation effects, and vibrant colors. For instance, I used the map() function to adjust the size of the images based on the song's rhythm, making them change with the music. I also employed color mapping to adjust the colors of the images according to the song's emotion, enhancing the visual experience. Overall, my design aims to align with the atmosphere and emotion of the song, creating a visually dynamic and tension-filled effect.


# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

What I am most proud of in the assignment is the seamless integration of visual elements with the dynamics and mood of the chosen song. I take pride in how the visuals effectively capture the essence of the music, conveying its energy, tension, and excitement to the audience. Additionally, I am proud of the technical proficiency demonstrated in implementing audio-responsive features, such as adjusting the size and color of shapes based on the song's rhythm and emotion. This not only showcases my creativity but also highlights my ability to translate auditory experiences into captivating visual narratives.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
